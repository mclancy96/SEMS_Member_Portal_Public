# SEMS Member Portal (Public version)
This is a public copy of Stockton University Emergency Medical Service's member portal which is made available for the purpose of making it easier for other collegiate EMS organizations to see and get ideas for their own websites/portals

<em> <strong> Most of the functions of the site have been disabled, all links to private organization files have been removed, and no database is connected to this site. </strong> </em> <small>I felt it necessary in order to protect the privacy of the organization. The website is not connected to a database, so any functions related to accessing the mongodb database originally designed for the project will not work and should be commented out. All of those links will simply not work.</small>

If you have any questions that I can answer, please let me know!
